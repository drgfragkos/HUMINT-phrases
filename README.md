# HUMINT-phrases
A collection of distinctive words that people fail to pronounce or fail to say "properly", despite how well their English is, allowing a third-party to distinguish (in some cases) their background/origin. 

These words/phrases act as a "tell" (like some people have a tell when playing poker, or when specific hand gestures are used by certain nationalities when speaking) allowing a profiler, a social engineer, an investigator to narrow down the background of the individual in question. The purpose of this repository is to be expanded by contributions acting as a good resource for HUMINT. 

This first iteration of this project starts with the assumption that the spoken language in question is English (EN), in an attempt to collect/identify which words in spoken English are pronounced in a distinctive way by individuals that can lead someone in narrowing down (or even identifying) the origin of the respective accent. Hopefully, future contributions will include more spoken languages. For example in order to make it more clear, a Greek (GR) repository with Greek words that are capable to identify the backgroung of people who might even speak Greek fluently. 

As the HUMINT phrases project gets more contributions, there will be an attempt to create a paragraph (a set of paragraphs per spoken language) which in theory could be read by any English-speaking individual, (irrespective which is their mother-tongue) and provide enough hints to identify (or narrow down) what kind of language-influences this individual has.
