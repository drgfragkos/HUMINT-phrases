# HUMINT-phrases
A collection of distinctive words that people fail to pronounce or fail to say "properly", despite how well their English is, allowing a third-party distinguish their background/origin. These words/phrases act as a "tell" (like some people have a tell when playing poker) allowing a profiler, a social engineer, an investigator to narrow down the background of the individual. The purpose of this repository is to be expanded by contributions acting as a good resource for HUMINT.
